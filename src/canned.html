      <p>
        I eat a lot of canned foods as part of my normal diet, which is
        something many people find bizarre about me. See below for some pictures
        of what I normally eat on a daily basis. There are some variations here
        and there based on the availability and cost of ingredients (I also try
        to keep my food costs reasonable without compromising on quality).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that not all ingredients shown are canned, but everything is
        prepared with use of a microwave or hot water kettle. I also get some
        perishables and non-canned ingredients from websites or local grocery
        stores, and I eat some fresh fruits and string cheese throughout the day
        as a snack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disclaimer: I do not necessarily recommend that you follow what I do,
        but this diet has worked for me so far since I started around January
        2022. I think canned ingredients are great for a variety of reasons, and
        I encourage people to use more of them as part of their daily cooking.
